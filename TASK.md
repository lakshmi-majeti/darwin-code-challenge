# Darwin Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in joining Darwin!

As a member of the Darwin team you will be contributing towards a rapid growing
new insurance brand, with a heavy focus on Agile engineering practices.

As such, this test is evaluating your engineering abilities in multiple levels.
To complete the exercise, feel free to use any tools available to you, as long
as your solution is written in Python and / or Java. Use any framework you'd
like, such as dropwizard, spring-boot, django or flask; or build it from the 
ground up if you prefer. Just be prepared to justify your choices later.

Feel free to use of Google, Stack Overflow, a template project, as long as you 
have the right to use said project. 

## Scenario

You are tasked to collect the following details from your users:
- Full name
- Email
- Password
- Phone number
- Department
- Job title

Write an API that can save, delete and display these details - make this as
production ready as possible within the time limit.

Feel free to ask your recruiter for clarification if needed, or if you prefer
to crack on straight away, just remember to document your  assumptions.

We do not expect a complete solution, what we are looking for is to understand
how you will approach this task; the decisions you will make and why; how you 
interpret the functional and non-functional requirements, etc. Feel free to go 
down the rabbit hole as much as time allows you.

We expect you to spend between 1 to 4 hours for your solution. 
Please try not to exceed this limit.

Your solution will be used in follow-up interviews.

### Bonus round

Extra points for demonstrating any CI/CD or IaC readiness.
